The `express-cloudinary-image-handler` package aims to simplify your image management tasks in Express.js applications that use Cloudinary. With just a few lines of code, you can upload and delete images from Cloudinary. The package includes a middleware to assist with image uploads and utility functions for both uploading and deleting images. While the focus is on ease of use, we've also paid attention to efficiency and error handling.
