### Upload Image to Cloudinary
<PAGE_HEADING_BOTTOM/>


The `uploadImagesToCloudinary` utility simplifies the Cloudinary image upload process, offering range of configuration options and prompt error detection with clear messaging.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

Let's first dive into an example. Afterward, we'll delve deeper into the syntax and configuration options of the `uploadImagesToCloudinary` utility:


```javascript showLineNumbers copy
// import express and anything else that you need
// import "uploadImagesToCloudinary"  from 'express-cloudinary-image-handler'

const app = express()

app.post('/upload-images', async (req, res) => {

    try {

        const upload_report = await uploadImagesToCloudinary({
            req: req,
            configuration: {
                formDataFieldName: 'productImages',
                cloudinaryFolderName: 'product',
                allowedExtensions: ['png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'],  // Optional
                maxFileSizeInKB: 512, // Optional
                maxNumberOfUploads: 10, // Optional
                deleteAllTempFiles: true // Optional
            }
        })

        if (upload_report.isError) {
            return res.json({
                status_code: upload_report.errorInfo.statusCode,
                message: upload_report.errorInfo.message
            })
        }

        return res.json({
            message: 'Uploaded Images Successfully',
            info: {
                uploaded_images_info: upload_report.imagesInfo
            }
        })
    } 
    
    catch (error) {
        return res.json({ message: "Something went wrong" });
    }
})
```

#### uploadImagesToCloudinary -  Multiple Instances

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>



In some scenarios, you may need to use the `uploadImagesToCloudinary` utility more than once within the same controller.

To do this effectively, you should set the `deleteAllTempFiles` property to `false`. This ensures that image files uploaded under different field names are not deleted after the first instance completes its operation.

Here's an example:


```javascript showLineNumbers {19, 40} copy
// import express and anything else that you need
// import "uploadImagesToCloudinary"  from 'express-cloudinary-image-handler'

const app = express()

app.post('/upload-product-images', async (req, res) => {

    try {

        // First Instance: Upload Main Product Display Images
        const featuredImagesUploadReport = await uploadImagesToCloudinary({
            req: req,
            configuration: {
                formDataFieldName: 'featuredImages',
                cloudinaryFolderName: 'product',
                allowedExtensions: ['png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'],
                maxFileSizeInKB: 512,
                maxNumberOfUploads: 10,
                deleteAllTempFiles: false  // Important
            }
        })

        // Handle errors for the first instance
        if (featuredImagesUploadReport.isError) {
            return res.json({
                status_code: featuredImagesUploadReport.errorInfo.statusCode,
                message: featuredImagesUploadReport.errorInfo.message
            })
        }

        // Second Instance: Upload Product Detail/Angle Images
        const productImagesUploadReport = await uploadImagesToCloudinary({
            req: req,
            configuration: {
                formDataFieldName: 'productImages',
                cloudinaryFolderName: 'product',
                allowedExtensions: ['png', 'jpg', 'jpeg'],
                maxFileSizeInKB: 512,
                maxNumberOfUploads: 10,
                deleteAllTempFiles: true // Now it's safe to delete
            }
        })

        // Handle errors for the second instance
        if (productImagesUploadReport.isError) {
            return res.json({
                status_code: productImagesUploadReport.errorInfo.statusCode,
                message: productImagesUploadReport.errorInfo.message
            })
        }

        // Success Response
        return res.json({
            message: 'Uploaded Images Successfully',
            info: {
                featuredImages: featuredImagesUploadReport.imagesInfo,
                productImages: productImagesUploadReport.imagesInfo
            }
        })
    } 
    
    catch (error) {
        return res.json({ message: "Something went wrong" })
    }
})
```

In this example, the first instance uploads main product display images with the field name `featuredImages` and the second instance uploads product detail or angle images with the field name `productImages`. The `deleteAllTempFiles` property is set to `false` in the first instance to retain the images for the second instance. In the second instance, it's set to `true` to clean up all temporary files after the operation is complete.




<HEADING_TOP_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

#### `deleteAllTempFiles` Property - Details

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

The `deleteAllTempFiles` is a property within the `configuration` parameter. It's optional, and its default value is set to `true`.


<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

**What It Does**

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>


This property controls the cleanup behavior for files temporarily stored in the server's "temp" folder during the upload process.

- **When `true`**:
  All files in the "temp" folder associated with the current upload operation, irrespective of their field names, are automatically deleted after the upload is complete. This ensures a clean temporary storage specific to the current operation, free from any residual files. 

- **When `false`**: 
  The utility will delete all image files that match the name set in `formDataFieldName` and any non-image files from the "temp" folder. However, it will retain image files that have different field names than the one specified in `formDataFieldName`.



<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

**Use Cases**

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

- **Set to `true`**: 
  Use this setting when you're uploading a batch of images in one go and want to ensure that the temporary storage is completely cleared afterward, leaving no leftover or unwanted files.

- **Set to `false`**: 
  Opt for this when you have multiple separate upload operations within the same controller. It ensures that files required for subsequent operations aren't mistakenly deleted by earlier tasks.

#### Naming Images in Cloudinary: Use Original Source File Name or Manually Set the Name  

<HEADING_BOTTOM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>


<Callout type="info">

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

**Is this seciton for you?**

    - In prior sections, discussions regarding file naming were put aside, as image names in cloudinary were generated automatically.

    - With image names produced through the automatic process, you find out the image's name only after its upload. 
    
    - However, if you need to determine the image's name before sending it to Cloudinary, this section is for you.
</Callout>

We've touched on the `uploadImagesToCloudinary` function, which requires a `configuration` parameter. This parameter is an object composed of several properties. All of these properties have been previously explained, except one: the `useSourceFileName` property.

This property is optional, accepting a boolean value with a default of false.

When set to `true`, the property allows the original source file name to be used as the Cloudinary image file's name. 


<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

**Manually Set the Name**

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

While using `useSourceFileName`, we can also manually set Name. This can be achieved by manipulating the frontend's FormData. Specifically, by providing a third parameter to the FormData, you can set the desired name for the image.

For instance:

```javascript copy
formData.append('image', 'image_file', 'desired_image_name');
```

In this example, `desired_image_name` will be the name assigned to the image when it's uploaded to Cloudinary.

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

**Ensuring Unique File Names**

<HALF_REM_SPACER___COMPONENT/>

One of the primary concerns of using the original file name is the potential risk of overwriting an existing image in Cloudinary. If a new image, bearing the same name as an existing one, is uploaded, the older image will be replaced. This can lead to unintentional replacements and potential data loss.

To mitigate the risk of overwriting files in Cloudinary due to name collisions, it's advisable to ensure that each file name is unique. One effective way to achieve this is by leveraging packages like `nanoid` to generate a unique identifier for each file. By appending or prepending this unique ID to the original file name, the chances of having two files with the same name become extremely low.

For example:

```javascript showLineNumbers copy
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';

// Generate a unique ID
const uniqueID = nanoid();

// Append the unique ID to the original file name
const uniqueFileName = `${uniqueID}_${image_info.img_file.name}`;

formData.append('image', image_name, uniqueFileName);
```

By adopting this approach, you not only retain the advantage of pre-determining the image's name before uploading but also ensure that each image has a distinct name, safeguarding against unintentional overwrites.
