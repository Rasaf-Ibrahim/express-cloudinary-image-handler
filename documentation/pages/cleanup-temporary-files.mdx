### Cleanup Temporary Files
<PAGE_HEADING_BOTTOM/>

The `cleanupTemporaryFiles` function is essential in handling a specific scenario in server management. When using `uploadImagesToCloudinary` for image uploads, it also cleans up any temporary files. However, there may be cases where your server logic returns a response before reaching the `uploadImagesToCloudinary` function, usually due to certain conditions not being met. In such situations, temporary files might still linger on the server. `cleanupTemporaryFiles` is designed for these instances, ensuring that any unwanted temporary files are removed, thus maintaining server efficiency and avoiding clutter.

#### Example

Imagine a scenario where you're uploading a file but need to check certain conditions first. If these conditions aren't met, you'd typically send back an error response. Before sending this response, you use `cleanupTemporaryFiles` to remove any files that were temporarily uploaded during the request process. This ensures your server remains clean and efficient, even when the usual upload and cleanup process is interrupted.

```javascript showLineNumbers copy
// import express and anything else that you need
// import "cleanupTemporaryFiles" & "uploadImagesToCloudinary"  from 'express-cloudinary-image-handler'

app.post('/upload-file', async (req, res) => {
    // condition check before uploading
    if (!isConditionMet(req)) {
        // If condition is not met, cleanup temporary files
        await cleanupTemporaryFiles({ req: req })
        // Send a response indicating the failure of condition
        return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Required condition not met' })
    }

    // If condition is met, the flow would normally proceed to 'uploadImagesToCloudinary' util
    // ... code to upload image using 'uploadImagesToCloudinary'
})
```
